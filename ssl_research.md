SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication between a client and server. TLS is the modern and more secure successor to SSL, which is now considered outdated. HTTPS (HTTP over TLS) encrypts data in transit, protecting it from interception or tampering, while plain HTTP leaves traffic vulnerable to attacks. Without SSL/TLS, risks include credential theft, man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, data leaks, and loss of user trust. Real-world incidents, such as the Equifax breach and cases where companies forgot to renew or configure certificates, have led to serious data exposure and downtime. This shows that proper SSL/TLS configuration is essential for both security and reliability in web applications.
